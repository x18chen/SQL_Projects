# SQL_Projects
Product and Order_sales are in excel spreadsheets. These two tables are originally for SAS practice (data cleaning, tables joining, data analysis and data report). 
I used these two tables for sql server practice. However, there is one issue for my sql practice, which is the sum(subtotal) for questions 3 and 5. My answers are slightly different from original answers obtained from SAS. 
If you have insights about this part, please share them with me.
